The Movie Mirror is an interactive installation that utilizes TensorFlow's PoseNet, matching the userâ€™s camera images with historical footage from over sixty films from the collection of the EYE Filmmuseum. From black-and-white classics and animations to short experimental films.

To see the installation in action at the Netherlands Film Festival, see [this video](https://vimeo.com/297292021).


## Pre-install
Before you go ahead and install this project. Be aware that movies that will be reflected back by the 'mirror' will have to be supplied by the user. Secondly, a dataset of poses in the scenes of the movies will need to be generated and inserted into a MongoDB database. Without these steps, the 'mirror' has nothing to reflect.

Also, the user needs a webcam connected to the pc for the application to analyse.

For further in depth reading of the technical side of this project, and for a explainaiting how you could create your own database please go to [Technisch Verslag](docs/technisch_verslag.md) (In Dutch)
