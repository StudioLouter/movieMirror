The Movie Mirror is an interactive installation that utilizes TensorFlow's PoseNet, matching the userâ€™s camera images with historical footage from over sixty films from the collection of the EYE Filmmuseum. From black-and-white classics and animations to short experimental films.

To see the installation in action at the Netherlands Film Festival, see [this video](https://vimeo.com/297292021) (in Dutch).


## Pre-install
Before you go ahead and install this project be aware that movies that will be reflected back by the 'mirror' will have to be supplied by the user. Secondly, a dataset of poses in movies will need to be generated and inserted into a MongoDB database. Without these steps, the 'mirror' has nothing to reflect.

Also, the user needs a webcam connected to the pc for the application to analyse.

For further in depth reading of the technical side of this project, and for a explanation how you could create your own database please go to [Technisch Verslag](docs/technisch_verslag.md) (In Dutch)

## How to install

Clone this repo into a directory:
```
cd path/to/directory
git clone https://github.com/studiolouter/movieMirror
```

Change directory to the repo that was just cloned:
```
cd movieMirror
```

And install its dependencies:
```
yarn
```

Build the distribute folder from source:
```
yarn run pack
```

It will keep watching for changes in source, and rebuild the distribute files if necessary.

## Database
Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) if you haven't already.

If you want to import / restore a backup of the movieMirror data, run 

```
yarn database:restore
```

This will access the dump files and restore the data found in `movieMirror/database/dump/zzw/houdingen.bson`

When the installation (and restoration) is succesful, start up a server by running 
```
yarn start:database
```


## Config
Once you have set up you MongoDB database, edit ``./src/renderer/assets/settings/Settings.js`` to reflect your MongoDB settings by changing the `database.name`, `database.host` and `database.collectionName`

Furthermore, scenes of the movies need to go inside `./static/video/scenes/{movieName}`. Inside this folder the filename should be named as `{movieName}-{###}.webm`.

> `{movieName}` Being the name of the movie without spaces, `{###}` the scene count.

The movie should then be added to `./static/data/MovieDimensions.yaml` width its width in pixels set. The video file should always have a height of 1080 pixels. 


## Start

When the build is succesful, start up a second terminal and run the following command to start the application
```
yarn start:client
```
